## Twitter Clone

This is a twitter clone made as a refresher while following [Spark School](http://trysparkschool.com/) which I saw posted on Hacker News the other day.

This version has some alterations such as

- Using a Postgres Docker instance rather than a locally installed MySQL database
- Uses ES6 syntax (let, => etc) rather than ES5
- Uses Knex to interact with the database rather than raw SQL queries

Mainly just acting as a refresher since it's been a wee bit since I did anything serious with Javascript.

The "course" is aimed at beginners so instead of taking 7 days, it's more like a few hours.

Why Docker? To make things needlessly complicated! Actually just because I'd forgotten how to set it up locally so this was a good excuse to figure it out.
